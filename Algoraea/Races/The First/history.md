	Though the race is said to be in hiding and to still be well and prospering, not a soul has seen them in over a millenia.
	
	The First Race was the first to be created by the Universe, the first to settle on Algoraea, the first to wield and develop magic, tame dragons and animals, the first to procreate, the first to do just about anything any mind can think of.
	
	It it common practice to believe that anyone who is of natural royal blood is a distant relative to the last known Firsts. Any natural royals left in the world are either in hiding from those who wish to hold them for ransom, relish in their natural "power" through cannabalistic means, or use them for creating a new and unpure bloodline.
	
	Many commoners pray to the Firsts as they are more real than the creators that have forsaken them and Algoraea, whether their prayers are answered through the First that may remain or if they are answered from the grave makes no difference to those who worship the Firsts. 
	
	It is told through old folk tales that if one were to ever see one of the First, they would gain much knowledge, great fortune, and be unable to contain themself. 

	Some old prophecy states that at some point in the incarnation of The Shifts a full-blood First will be born from those of diluted lineage, and this new blood shall be one the heeds the world, the one that can conquer its people, land, and begin to heal what was lost.
