###The Gated City of Seirisha. 

A monument city to the world from The Saphks. Second in size and populous only to Erina, the Capital City. It is a testament to the great ingenuity and magical prowess in how long it has stood without being conquered all but once. 
It is said that this city is the only one that has stood since the beginning of time, since The First Race.
