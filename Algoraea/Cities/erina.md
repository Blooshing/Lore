###The Capital City, Erina

The Great Capital City of Algoraea, Erina, was built from the ruins of the old capital, Tolli, and was swiftly named after the Old King's wife.
Though history does not forget the war, those who reap the pleasures of living in the capital dare not look into its past, for if one is to doubt the foundation that they live their life on, 
it will surely come to a ruin. Ah! Yes, the grandiose golden brimmed palace overlooking the entirity of the city-state  
As much hussle and bussle that goes on during the day, that is only a fraction of what goes on during the night. 
It is said that anyone who ventures out past sunfall in Erina is either said to be oneof the bravest souls or one of the foolest. 
Much lay to be uncovered in Erina for secrets of war and the past are well hidden, but not showing through the cracks.
