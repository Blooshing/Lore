###The Ancient City, Ylon

A Relic City. All who pass through here know that it is no place for trading and no place for conflict. No, those who know of and pass through this city are expected to revere it as sacred, holy, to never defile it. This Sacred Land is known to be the biggest city to exist, if it were alive.
The city was the first city to be built, created by the Firsts. This city, now deserted, with no sign of life or prosperity is known to just be a holy place. Pray, give, and to not defile. 
There is a story of a wanderer, Rosk, who decided to take what was not given to him in Ylon, something so small as food and water that was left out there to just become hard, moldy, and unedible within the week, was enough to make his life a living hell. It is said that with the first bite of the bread his tastebuds started to prune and have no taste or sensation - making the bread unsavory - starving, Rosk continued to eat the bread. With every bite Rosk continued to lose more and more of what made them Algoraean. It is said that by the time the bread was fully consumed Rosk aged 80 years, was emmaciated, blind, deaf, incoherent, and psychologically insane. When ever Rosk did say something comprehensible, it was as if the First were talking in their dead language through Rosk and warning those who've yet to believe.
